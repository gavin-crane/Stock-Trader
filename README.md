# Stock-Trader
Automatic trading and selling of various stocks based on a trading/selling strategy

This was from a SQL class where we learned how to use SQL and prepared statements to retrieve and use data from a database.
The data was Stock information from various companies.

The program reads stock data of a specified ticker and date range and then executes a buying/selling strategy between those dates.
The result outputs to terminal total shares, bought and sold, and net profit. The program also tells the user when stock splits occur
and accounts for it when executing the buying/selling strategy.
